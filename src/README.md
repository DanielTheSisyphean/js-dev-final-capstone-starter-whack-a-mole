This is a capstone project used for my Chegg studies. 

IMPORTANT: Please do not distribute this project, as it is only a test project and does not properly meet the copyright requirements required by Youtube and the relevant artists. 

This is based off of "Whack A Mole" and offers the opportunity to collect newly-born stars flying from the hearts of nebulas! Be careful though, these stars are moving quite fast and it can be hard to catch them!
